#### Execution rights ####
* Scripts have execution rights for the user executing them.

An execution right is represented by x. In the example below, my user has the rwx (read, write, execute) rights for the file test_script.sh

### File colour
* Executable scripts appear in a different colour from rest of the files and folders.

In my case, the scripts with execution rights appear as green.

### How to Create Your First Bash Script
* Let's create a simple script in bash that outputs Hello World.

//Create a file named hello_world.sh//
touch hello_world.sh
//Find the path to your bash shell//
which bash

In my case, the path is /usr/bin/bash and I will include this in the shebang.
