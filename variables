/// How to define variables///
We can define a variable by using the syntax variable_name=value. To get the value of the variable, add $ before the variable.

#!/bin/bash
# A simple variable example
greeting=hello
name=srihari
echo $greeting $name

Output : hello srihari

/// Arithmetic Expressions ///
Below are the operators supported by bash for mathematical calculations:

OPERATOR    	USAGE
+         	addition
-	          subtraction
*	          multiplication
/         	division
**	        exponentiation
%	          modulus


///Numerical expressions can also be calculated and stored in a variable using the syntax below:

var=$((expression))

Let's try an example.
#!/bin/bash

var=$((3+9))
echo $var

output: 12
